Layer 2 Devices in the OSI Model
---------------------------------

1. Switches:
- Connect multiple devices within a network.
- Operate at the Data Link Layer to forward frames based on MAC addresses.
- Reduce network congestion by creating separate collision domains for each connected device.

2. Bridges:
- Connect and filter traffic between two or more network segments.
- Operate at the Data Link Layer to forward data based on MAC addresses.
- Used to reduce network congestion by dividing larger networks into smaller segments.

3. Network Interface Cards (NICs):
- Allow devices to connect to a network.
- Operate at both the Physical Layer and the Data Link Layer.
- Responsible for addressing and framing data to be sent over the network.

4. Wireless Access Points (WAPs):
- Connect wireless devices to a wired network.
- Operate at the Data Link Layer to manage wireless communications.
- Provide network access to Wi-Fi-enabled devices.

5. MAC Address Tables:
- Used by switches and bridges to make forwarding decisions.
- Operate at the Data Link Layer by mapping MAC addresses to specific network ports.

6. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks):
- Logical segmentation of networks.
- Operate at the Data Link Layer to manage traffic based on VLAN tags.
- Improve network management
